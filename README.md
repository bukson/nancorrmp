Multiprocessing correlation calculation for Python
=======================
`nancorrmp` is a small module for calculating correlations of big numpy arrays or pandas dataframes with
 NaNs and infs, using multiple cores. Default `numpy.corrcoef` method does not calculate correlations
 with input that contains NaNs and infs and `pandas` method `pandas.DataFrame.corr` is single thread
 only. 
 
 `nancorrmp` utilizes Pearson correlation calculation code from `scipy`, that is based on `numpy` instead
 of `pandas` cythonic backed. The multiprocessing is implemented by python `multiprocessing` module. 
 `nancorrmp` uses `pandas` method of calculating correlations of arrays with NaNs and infs,
 that skips pair of observations when one of them is either Nan or +inf, or -inf. `nancorrmp` also
 can calculate result with p values, similar to `scipy.pearsonr` function.
 
 Benchmarks are showing that with 4 cores, calculating correlation is faster with `nancorrmp` then with `pandas`
 even for 1200x1200 matrix. With 2 cores it is for 2400x2400. `pandas` single processed implementation is faster
 then using single process `nancorrmp` still for 5000x5000 matrix, so it is recommended to use `nancorrmp` with at least
 2 cores.

Installation
============

```
pip install nancorrmp
```
Usage
=====
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from nancorrmp.nancorrmp import NaNCorrMp
from pandas.testing import assert_frame_equal

np.random.seed(0)
random_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100, 100))
corr = NaNCorrMp.calculate(random_dataframe)
corr_pandas = random_dataframe.corr()
assert_frame_equal(corr, corr_pandas)
corr, p_value = NaNCorrMp.calculate_with_p_value(random_dataframe)
```

NaNCorrMp Methods
=================
`nancorrmp` module has one static class named `NaNCorrMp` with 2 public methods and 1 type

**ArrayLike = Union[pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray]**


Type used to unify `pd.DataFrame` and `np.ndarray`. 


**NaNCorrMp.calculate(X: ArrayLike, n_jobs: int = -1, chunks: int = 500) -> ArrayLike**

Calculates correlation matrix using Pearson correlation. `n_jobs` controls number of cores to use
with default -1 which uses all available cores. `chunks` controls how many pairs of arrays are send to
each process, 500 should be suitable for all purposes. 

Returns output as the same type as input, if `X` is `pd.Dataframe` it will return `pd.Dataframe`, if
`X` is `np.ndarray` it will return `np.ndarray`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from nancorrmp.nancorrmp import NaNCorrMp

np.random.seed(0)
random_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100, 100))
corr = NaNCorrMp.calculate(random_dataframe)
```


**NaNCorrMp.calculate_with_p_value(X: ArrayLike, n_jobs: int = -1, chunks: int = 500) -> Tuple[ArrayLike, ArrayLike]**

Calculates correlation matrix and p value matrix using Pearson correlation. `n_jobs` controls number of cores to use
with default -1 which uses all available cores. `chunks` controls how many pairs of arrays are send to
each process, 500 should be suitable for all purposes. Correlation and p value are the same as the result of 
using `scipy.pearsonr`, but it can be used with NaNs and infs and multiple cores.

Returns output as similar type as input, if `X` is `pd.Dataframe` it will return `(pd.Dataframe, pd.Dataframe)`, if
`X` is `np.ndarray` it will return `(np.ndarray, np.ndarray)`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from nancorrmp.nancorrmp import NaNCorrMp

np.random.seed(0)
random_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100, 100))
corr, p_value = NaNCorrMp.calculate_with_p_value(random_dataframe)
```


Benchmark
============

Results can be reproduced by using `test/test_benchmark_nancorrmp.py` module

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from nancorrmp.nancorrmp import NaNCorrMp

np.random.seed(0)
random_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(1200, 1200))

%timeit NaNCorrMp.calculate(random_dataframe, n_jobs=4, chunks=1000)
# 9.92 s ± 205 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

%timeit random_dataframe.corr()
# 10.4 s ± 56.1 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

random_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(2400, 2400))

%timeit NaNCorrMp.calculate(random_dataframe, n_jobs=2, chunks=1000)
# 1min 26s ± 3.16 s per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

%timeit random_dataframe.corr()
# 1min 45s ± 3.58 s per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

Test
====

`test` module contains test both for single core usage as for multiple cores. Tests asserts
then the outuput of `NaNCorrMp.calculate` is the same as output of `pandas.corr` for the same data.
